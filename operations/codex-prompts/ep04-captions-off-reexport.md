# EP4 — remove burned captions, re-export (surgical, do NOT rebuild)

*2026-07-22. The assembly in CapCut project `0722` is CORRECT and COMPLETE — all 54 placements,
every animation, right order, synced to narration, 20:22. Verified. The ONLY problem is the
captions are burned OVER the picture. This is a one-change fix. Do not re-cut, re-order, or
re-render anything else.*

## THE ONE CHANGE
1. Open CapCut project `0722` (`/Users/alisoneakin/Movies/CapCut/User Data/Projects/com.lveditor.draft/0722`).
2. **Delete the CAPTION / text track entirely.** The exported video must contain **NO captions
   of ANY kind** — not over the art, not in a bottom bar, not letterboxed, none. A CLEAN,
   full-frame picture only. ⛔ Do NOT re-calibrate captions to a bottom band — REMOVE them.
   The website player renders captions in its own bar BELOW the video, and viewers toggle them
   there; and YouTube uses the VTT as a sidecar. The video file itself carries zero captions.
3. Change NOTHING else — same clips, same order, same timing, same audio.
4. **Re-export to `assets/video/episode-04-full-v4.mp4`** (1920x1080, H.264, with the narration
   audio). Do NOT overwrite `v2` or the caption-bugged `v3`.

## QC (one look)
1. Play any point — there is NO text over the picture anywhere.
2. Runtime still 20:22.40.
3. The animations, order, and audio are unchanged from v3.

*Standing art-requirements below (carried so the guardrail hook passes; this task generates no
new art, so they apply only if a frame is re-rendered):*

## HARD REQUIREMENTS — a frame failing any of these is rejected

**1 · Exactly 1920 × 1080.** Wrong dimensions are auto-rejected before review.

**2 · Style `comic-v1-locked`** — bold black ink, HARD ANGULAR shadow PLANES, flat saturated colour. ⛔ No halftone. ⛔ Not painterly, watercolour, airbrushed or blotchy.

**3 · CONTINUITY IS NOT OPTIONAL.** Each frame below names the shot before it and/or after it *in the same scene*. The new frame must read as the same room, the same moment, the same person — same hair, same clothes, same light, same period. If the anchor shows her in a green dress at a desk by a window, she is still in that green dress at that desk. ⛔ Do not restyle, re-cast or re-dress between shots.

**4 · LIKENESS.** Every named real woman has a photo reference path. Match HER face. ⛔ Do not invent a plausible person. A woman appearing in several beats uses the SAME reference in every one.

**5 · SETTING MUST BE REAL.** A real SUNNYVAiLE building or a genuine historical location. ⛔ No invented places. ⛔ No literal mashups — do not weld a biographical detail onto a technical one (e.g. a dataset's photos pinned up inside a family's dry-cleaning shop).

**5b · SUNNYVAiLE GEOGRAPHY IS CANON.** If two or more buildings appear in one shot, they must be neighbours in the real town. ⛔ Do not invent an adjacency to fill a frame.

> **MAiN Street, in order:** 1 Visitor's Centre · 2 NewsStand · 3 Chick Flicks · 4 Blend & Snap · 5 Mme CLAi-O's · 6 MAiKEOVER on MAiN · 7 BRONZE AiGE · 8 Dream Phone booth · 9 The Mall · 10 KSVL 99.9
>
> **NOT on MAiN** — these are on cross streets that run BEHIND it: **LIBRAiRY, Town Hall, Post Office** (Civic Square — LIBRAiRY on the RIGHT, Post Office on the LEFT) · **SUNNYVAiLE High** (Schoolhouse Road) · **FAiRY Godmother's house** (Willow Lane) · **Delta LAi Nu** (Wisteria Lane) · **The LUMINAiRY** (Lantern Hill).

⛔ **The LIBRAiRY is NOT on MAiN Street and is NOT beside Blend & Snap.** This exact error has now been made three times — `main-street-golden`, `main-street-dusk` (both re-rolled 2026-07-06) and `ep04-around-town-b-comic-v1` (banned 2026-07-22). Full layout: memory `sunnyvaile-street-layout-canon`.

**6 · PHYSICAL PLAUSIBILITY.** Objects obey physics. A stack of paper is separate sheets with edges, not a solid slab with text printed on its side.

**6b · ANATOMY.** Every figure has a complete, correctly-jointed body. If a person is shown below the waist she has **legs and feet** that connect to her hips and reach the ground. ⛔ No body that simply stops behind a foreground object. ⛔ No missing or extra limbs, no hands with the wrong number of fingers, no head attached at an impossible angle. If a prop would crop the figure, crop the FRAME deliberately — do not delete the body part.

**7 · "AI" is ALWAYS both letters capital** — never "Ai". The accented i belongs to brand words only (LAiDIES, SUNNYVAiLE, MAiVENS, LUMINAiRY).

**6c · PERIOD ACCURACY.** Nothing in frame may postdate the year of the scene — no flat screens in 1952, no mobile phones in 1946, no modern typography on period signage. The LOCATION must be the real place the event happened. The NUMBER of people must be right (the ENIAC programmers are SIX).

**6d · AGE.** Each woman is the age she was AT THIS MOMENT, not her famous later portrait. Grace Hopper in 1952 is 45 and a civilian — not the white-haired Rear Admiral of decades later.

**6e · BACKGROUND FIGURES.** Faces in the background must be coherent — no melted, smeared or half-formed features. If a face cannot be drawn cleanly at that size, turn the figure away or move it further back.

**7b · EVERY WORD LEGIBLE AND CORRECT.** No garbled or invented lettering anywhere — signage, screens, book spines, papers. Check numbers: KSVL is **99.9**. Check brand spellings: LUMINAiRY has ONE accented i. ⛔ Do not letter a word you cannot render cleanly — leave the surface plain instead.

**8b · READS AT VIDEO SIZE.** The subject must be legible when this plays at 1/3 screen. ⛔ No critical detail so small it disappears — if the beat is about a face, the face is large in frame.

**8 · Populated SUNNYVAiLE scenes** = women in Y2K-era dress, diverse. Storefronts empty.

**9 · Never mix generations.** No pixel, `comic-barsetter` or `comic-v2-graphic-novel` frames scavenged or adapted. Draw fresh in `comic-v1-locked`.

**10 · Text rendered IN-generation.** No blank plates for text added later.

### 🔴 THE HEROINE'S OUTFIT — ONE LOOK FOR THE WHOLE EPISODE
She wears a **different outfit each week, and the SAME outfit in every frame of a given episode**, with 90s-styled hair.

> **EPISODE OUTFIT:** _injected per episode from `episode-0N.canon.md` → `## heroine_outfit`_

⛔ **NEVER corporate.** No navy pantsuit, no blazer-and-blouse, no office tailoring. SUNNYVAiLE is a Y2K town and she lives there — she does not commute in from a law firm. In the Ep4 batch she appeared in four different outfits, four of them corporate.
